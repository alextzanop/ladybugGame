Hello, friend!
As you remember, we scheduled this training drill in order to teach you how to use our latest weapon...
THE PEAR CANNON!!
...oh?
You don't remember? Oh boy, how deep did you sleep last night hehe.
You are here because you are the highest among our pear army ranks.
It is you that our majesty, the Royal Pear, has chosen to use this canon in order to protect our kingdom from our enemies...
...The Ladybugs!
As you remember(or don't, apparently), the Ladybugs are our great enemy.
They were seen marching in our kingdom to infiltrate our pear juice deposits and steal all of it!
And we cannot let it happen, of course. This is where you come in, so let's get started.
I've set up some dummy Ladybugs across you to help with your training.
Firstly, try rotating the canon.

Noice moves!
Now, let's move to the good stuff. You get to shoot things!
So, take a look at the Ladybug props.

These green bars you see on them is their endurance.
With every shot you take at them, their endurance falls. When they run out of endurance they...
..well, you know how it goes.
So go ahead, pew pew!
enableShoot
Noice, looks like you got the hang of it!
As you might have noticed, the ladybugs in the back took longer to defeat.
In general, the farther they are the less damage they take. So keep that in mind for when you get to the battlefield.
And of course, the real ones are going to be moving.
Your job is to not let them get get past your line of defence. We need to protect our delicious pear juice.
So, let's go to battle!
